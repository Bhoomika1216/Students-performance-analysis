ðŸ“Š Students Performance Analysis â€“ Power BI Project
This project presents an interactive and visually engaging Power BI dashboard that analyzes student academic performance using various demographic and educational factors. The goal is to uncover insights into how factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses influence student scores in math, reading, and writing.
ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- To explore how different socio-economic and preparatory factors impact student performance.
- To build an interactive dashboard that provides quick insights into performance trends.
- To demonstrate proficiency in using Power BI features including DAX, data modeling, and visual storytelling.
ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Students who completed test preparation courses performed significantly better.
- Higher parental education correlates with better average scores.
- Female students tended to score higher on reading and writing, while male students did better in math.
- Students with standard lunch performed better than those on free/reduced lunch.
